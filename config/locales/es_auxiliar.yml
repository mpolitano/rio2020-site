    The Summer School of Informatic has been held annually since 1994, organized by Computing Departament of the Exactc Physical-Chemical and natural Sciences Faculty of Univervesity of Rio Cuarto
    The courses that make up this Summer School have been taught by specialists, teacher and researchers, both from Argentina and other country.
    These courses have been attended by professionals, teacher and students from educational istitutions from all over country and from neighboring countries.
    The RIO 2020 will be held from February 24 to 28, 2020, and will consist of intensive courses, taught by leading academics.
    In adittion, certificates of assintance will be given to those who attend al least 80% of the classes taughy and, in case of satisfactorily fulfilling the required evaluation.
    A certificate of approval will be delivered.
    The main objectives of the school are:
    Provide students and teachers of the computer careers of the UNRC, other national universities and the entire computer community, intensive and brief refresher and specialization courses taught by first-rate teachers and researchers.
    Make available to the students of the computer careers of the UNRC a broad and diverse vision of the field of Computer Science and facilitate academic exchange with other houses of study.
    Promote the participation of students of the UNRC's Computer careers in other similar events in Universities of the country and abroad.

  course2_detail: Detailed description of the course (in Spanish)
  course2_prerequisites1: 
    It's important for attendants to have sufficient knowledge on programming, 
    knowledge on programming, as this course is hands-on.
  course2_prerequisites2: 
    Acceptable languages are Smalltalk, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript and PHP.
  course2_prerequisites3: 
    The software requirements for taking the course (this is for students' own computers) is simply 
    to have the programming language installed (with a suitable IDE), and a corresponding xUnit framework.
  course3_prerequisites: While it is recommended that attendants are already familiar with basic 
    concepts from probability theory and programming languages, this course 
    will go through all the necessary concepts. It is a self-content course that should 
    be accessible to any Computer Science student.
  course4_prerequisites: >
    Basic knowledge on discrete mathematics and propositional (boolean) logic.
  course2_description: Differential Privacy offers ways to answer statistical queries about
      sensitive data while providing strong provable privacy guarantees
      ensuring that the presence or absence of a single individual in the
      data has a negligible statistical effect on the query's result.
      Differential privacy is becoming a gold standard in data privacy and
      it is now used by statistical agencies like the US Census Bureau and
      companies like Apple, Google, and Uber.
      This course will focus on fundamental results about the theory
      and practice of differential privacy and how to use it in concrete
      applications. In particular, the course will introduce students to
      some fundamental mechanisms for building differentially private queries.
      The course will also present a novel framework for programming
      such queries and how to use them to design privacy-preserving applications
      that take into account not only the privacy of individuals but also the accuracy
      of obtained statistical results. This tool has been developed by the speakers
      and their collaborators.
  course3_description1:  >
    In the last few years, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have 
    received increasing attenting, both from academia and industry. To a great extent, this is 
    due to the way in which these languages have revolutionized artificial intelligence. 
    For instance, modern PPLs can do in 50 lines of code what previously required over 1000.
  course3_description2:  >
    The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the "world" of PPLs, in a broad manner,
    covering both practical aspects and foundations. We will start by discussing the benefits and 
    potential of probabilistic computational models, going through their main applications, 
    putting special emphasis on the cause of this revolution: artificial intelligence and bayesian 
    reasoning. The second part of the course will cover the main challenges in the design and 
    implementation of PPLs. Finally, we will discuss the formal semantics and different 
    verification techniques for probabilistic programs.
